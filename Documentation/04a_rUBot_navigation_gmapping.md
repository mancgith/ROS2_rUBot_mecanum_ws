SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) navigation aims to simultaneously map an unknown environment and localize the robot within it. It generates an optimal trajectory to a specified target point and navigates along this path, continuously updating the map and avoiding obstacles to ensure efficient and autonomous movement.

There are different methods:
- SLAM gmapping: to create 2D occupancy maps from laser and position data. Ideal for small indoor environments with low scan frequency.
- Cartographer: Provides real-time SLAM in 2D and 3D, compatible with multiple platforms and sensor configurations. Known for its accuracy and ability to work with multi-sensor data.
- RTAB-MAP: A library and standalone application for visual and lidar SLAM. Supports various platforms and sensors.
